## Macbook

### Python Interactive Shell  

- EXIT the python interactive shell:  
```ctrl + z```  

### VS Code
- VSCode [Keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) cheatsheet.  

- OPEN/CLOSE the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal):  
```ctrl + backtick```  

- Install [PYLINT](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) for linting in Python:  
```shift + cmd + p```  
Type LINT or PYTHON to make sure it is on and/or active  

- Show Linting issues:  
```shift + cmd + m```  
Open this window and keep active while coding in your `.py` file.  

- Format Document using PEP-8:  
```shift + cmd + p```  
While in a `.py` file, periodically type FORMAT DOCUMENT.  This will automatically adjust the code to match the PEP-8 style guide.  The best method is to select the `formatOnSave` option in preferences/settings.  

- Install [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) so that you can easily run your `.py` programs without having to go to the terminal and type `python app.py` etc. each time you want to run the program.  
```shift + alt + n```
