# Variables and Methods
[HOME](../../README.md)  

The most basic python building block is the variable.  


1. Make variable names descriptive and meaningful:  
    - `product_type = "Glove"`
    - `tax_percent = 0.37`
    - `qty_entered = 12`
    - `case_count = 144`  

2. Use lowercase letters to name variables.  
3. Use an underscore to separate multiple words.  Thus, making them more readable.
