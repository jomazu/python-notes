Python has a built-in function for getting the length of a string (the number of characters in a string):  
- `len`  

But, what is a built-in function?  

A function is basically a reusable piece of code that carries out a specific task.  

As a metaphor... think of your handheld TV Remote.  It has built-in functions like, power on, power off, change the channel, and start recording etc.  These are some of the built-in functions that come pre-installed with your TV.  

In Python and many other programming languages, we have the exact same concept built into the language or platform.
